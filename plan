Step 1: Create a 3-Node Vault Cluster for High Availability
We will create 3 EC2 instances and configure them as a Vault cluster with three nodes: Vault-1, Vault-2, and Vault-3.
If one Vault server goes down, the other two automatically handle the system.
This ensures that our Vault system is never fully shut down and provides high availability for production workloads.

Step 2: Store Vault Data in Raft
Vault secrets will be stored using Raft storage, which is a built-in storage method:
One node acts as the leader, where data is primarily stored.
The other two nodes replicate this data so that all nodes have the same information.
Benefit: If one server crashes, the other nodes still have the data, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

Step 3: Auto-Unseal Vault Using AWS KMS
When Vault starts, it is initially sealed, requiring unseal keys to unlock it.
Normally, we would need to manually enter 3 unseal keys, which is time-consuming.
To automate this, we use AWS KMS to securely store unseal keys.
When Vault starts, it automatically retrieves the keys from AWS KMS and unseals itself.
Benefit: This is secure, efficient, and reduces manual intervention.
